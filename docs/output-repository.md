# Output Repository Contract

This document defines the guaranteed structure and constraints of repositories generated by Gitx.

Every generated project repository MUST conform to this contract.

---

## Purpose

The output repository represents the final, immutable result of a Gitx generation request.

It is not a collaborative workspace.
It is a generated artifact.

---

## Mandatory Structure

Every generated repository MUST include the following at minimum:
```
├── README.md
├── src
  └── (generated source files)
  └── .gitignore
```
Additional files may be included depending on project type.

---

## README Requirements

Each generated repository README MUST include:

- Project name
- Short project description
- Generation timestamp
- Generation source (Gitx)
- Generation authority (`gitx-bot`)
- Disclaimer that the repository is auto-generated

---

## Commit Rules

- The repository MUST contain at least one commit
- The first commit MUST include the full generated project
- The commit MUST be authored by `gitx-bot`
- Commit history is not guaranteed to be stable

---

## Mutability Rules

- Generated repositories are immutable by default
- Users are free to fork or clone the repository
- Gitx does not maintain or update generated repositories unless explicitly requested

---

## Access Model

- Repositories are public by default
- Write access is restricted to the Gitx system
- No assumptions are made about long-term maintenance

---

## Contract Stability

This contract applies to all generated repositories unless explicitly versioned otherwise.

Breaking changes to this contract require:
- Explicit documentation
- Clear version signaling

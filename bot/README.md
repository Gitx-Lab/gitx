# Gitx Bot

This directory defines the Gitx bot.

The bot is a constrained automation agent responsible for applying
validated generation outputs into concrete repositories.

It does not define platform rules.
It does not make decisions.
It does not interpret intent.

---

## Purpose

The Gitx bot exists to:

- Materialize approved generation outputs
- Create repositories following strict contracts
- Enforce structural guarantees

The bot operates only within predefined limits.

---

## What the Bot Can Do

- Create repositories
- Write files exactly as specified
- Apply fixed directory structures
- Commit with deterministic messages

All actions are mechanical and repeatable.

---

## What the Bot Cannot Do

- Change platform documentation
- Modify specifications
- Invent structure or content
- Interpret ambiguous instructions
- Operate without explicit input

The bot has no discretionary power.

---

## Authority Boundary

The bot is subordinate to:

- Platform specifications
- Documentation contracts
- Explicit generation requests

If an instruction conflicts with documentation,
the documentation always wins.

---

## Failure Behavior

If a request violates constraints, the bot must:

- Abort execution
- Produce no output
- Report failure explicitly

Silent correction is not allowed.
